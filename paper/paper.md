# Summary

Scientists across all disciplines frequently combine diverse computational tools into computational pipelines (a.k.a. scientific workflows) to solve specific data analysis problems. Software registries provide large collections of computational tools, often with rich metadata that captures their functional and non-functional properties. However, finding the right (combinations of) tools for building a problem-specific workflow remains a challenge. 

Therefore we have developed the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE)^[https://github.com/sanctuuary/ape] [@kasalica2020] to support workflow developers in systematically exploring the possible pipelines of tools for a given computational problem. Like a route planner, it takes a starting point (input data), destination (desired outputs) and possibly additional constraints (such as kinds of operations to use), and returns a set of possible routes (pipelines) that meet the request. As described in detail in [@kasalica2019], internally the framework uses an extension of the well-known Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to encode the workflow specification. This specification is translated into a propositional logic formula and handed over to a SAT solver, with the resulting solutions representing possible workflows. 

Working with APE has three main phases: 
1) Modeling of the *domain knowledge*, which provides the base on which APE relies for the exploration of workflows. It comprises lightweight ontologies, used to annotate operations and data from the domain in form of semantic hierarchies, and tool annotations, i.e. input and output dependencies of the tools. Ideally, the modelling is performed by a small group of domain experts. 
2) *Problem specification*, where the user describes the data analysis problem to solve using the vocabulary provided by the domain model. A problem specification for APE comprises the workflow inputs, the desired outputs, and constraints that the workflow has to fulfill. The constraints are exposed in the form of fill-in-the-blank templates (such as "Use operation X" or "If tool X is used, tool Y cannot be used subsequently", etc.). 
3) Performing the actual *workflow exploration*. Finally, the obtained candidate solutions that satisfy the specification are returned. The solutions can be presented as workflow structures, executable implementations (such as shell scripts) and/or exported into standard workflow formats (such as CWL) [@amstutz_common_2016].

APE has successfully been used for the automated composition of workflows for data analysis in mass spectrometry-based proteomics [@palmblad_automated_2018] (based on the EDAM ontology [@ison2013edam] and the bio.tools [@ison_tools_2016] registry as domain models), creation of thematic maps depicting bird movement patterns in the Netherlands [@kasalicaLamprecht2019] (based on the GMT collection of mapping tools [@wessel_generic_2013]), and creation of a liveability atlas of Amsterdam [@scheiderCCD2020] (based on standard GIS operations as provided by ArcGIS). Further applications, in particular in bioinformatics and geosciences, are currently being developed. 

APE has been inspired by the ideas behind the PROPHETS framework for synthesis-based loose programming [@Lampre2013; @LaNaMS2010; @StMaFr1993], the automated chaining of scientific web services in jORCA/Magallanes [@KaMaRT2010], and the AI planning-based automated workflow instantiation in WINGS [@gil_wings:_2011]. 
However, it sets itself apart from these systems by a clear focus on workflow/pipeline exploration in a stand-alone library that is independent from any concrete workflow system. Thus, workflow management systems [@martin_high-level_2009; @cwl_computational_ws] can integrate APE functionality and make automated workflow exploration available to their users.
