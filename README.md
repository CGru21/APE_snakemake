# APE (Automated Pipeline Explorer)

APE is a command line tool and API for the automated exploration of possible computational pipelines (workflows) from large collections of computational tools. 

APE relies on a semantic domain model that includes tool and type taxonomies as controlled vocabularies for the description of computational tools, and functional tool annotations (inputs, outputs, operations performed) using terms from these taxonomies. Based on this domain model and a specification of the available workflow inputs, the intended workflow outputs and possibly additional constraints, APE then computes possible workflows. 

Internally, APE uses a component-based program synthesis approach. It translates the domain knowledge and workflow specification into logical formulas that are then fed to a SAT solver to compute satisfying instances. These solutions are then translated into the actual candidate workflows.

## Requirements

In order to [run](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE#command-line-interface-cli) APE you need to have [Java 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) (or higher) installed on the system. To [build](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE#how-to-build-ape-from-source) the APE module from source code, [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) has to be installed as well.

## How to build APE from source

### Using Maven
From the project root, simply launch
```shell
$ mvn -DskipTests=true install
```
to build the APE modules from the source tree and the built files will be generated under the `/target` directory. All the dependencies will be gathered by Maven and the following stand-alone module will be generated: `APE-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## CLI & API
Automated workflow composition with APE can be performed through its command line interface (CLI) or its application programming interface (API). While the CLI provides a simple means to interact and experiment with the system, the API provides more flexibility and control over the synthesis process. It can be used to integrate APEâ€™s functionality into other systems.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
When running APE-&lt;version>.jar from the command line, it requires a JSON configuration file given as a parameter and executes the automated workflow composition process accordingly. This configuration file (see [ape cofiguration example](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/blob/master/SimpleDemo/ape.configuration)) provides references to all therefor required information:
1. *Domain model* - annotation of the types and tools in the domain in form of an **ontology** (see [ontology example](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/blob/master/SimpleDemo/GMT_Demo_UseCase.owl) in OWL) and a **tool annotation file** (see [tool annotations example](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/blob/master/SimpleDemo/tool_annotations.json) in JSON).
2. *Workflow specification* - including a list of **workflow inputs/outputs** and template-based (see [constraint templates](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/blob/master/SimpleDemo/constraint_templates.json)) **workflow constraints** (see [workflow constraints example](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/blob/master/SimpleDemo/constraints.json))
3. *Parameters* for the synthesis execution, such as the number of desired solutions, output directory, system configurations, etc.

To run the APE CLI use:

```shell
java -jar APE-<version>.jar configuration.json
```

For more details check a [simple demo](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/tree/master/SimpleDemo).

### Application Programming Interface (API)

Like the CLI, the APE API relies on a configuration file that references the domain ontology, tool annotations, workflow specification and execution parameters.

```java
// set up the framework
APE ape = new APE("path/to/setup-configuration.json");

// run the synthesis
SATsolutionsList solutions = ape.runSynthesis("path/to/run-configuration.json");
```

However, the API allows to edit this file programmatically, and thus for instance add constraints or change execution parameters dynamically. 

```java
// set up the framework
JSONObject setupConfig = ...
APE ape = new APE(setupConfig);

// run the synthesis
JSONObject runConfig = ...
SATsolutionsList solutions1 = ape.runSynthesis(runConfig);

// run the synthesis again with altered parameters
runConfig.put("use_workflow_input", "ONE");
SATsolutionsList solutions2 = ape.runSynthesis(runConfig);
```

## Demo 
A web browser demonstrator (beta) of can be found at: http://ape.science.uu.nl/
Docker version of the demonstrator is available at: https://github.com/sanctuuary/Burke_Docker

Our use cases are motivated by practical problems in various domains (e.g. bioinformatisc, GIS). Multiple predefined scenarios of scientific workflow synthesis can be found at [GitHub Use Cases Repository](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases).

## Credits
APE has been inspired by the [Loose Programming framework PROPHETS](http://ls5-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/projects/prophets/index.php). It uses similar mechanisms for semantic domain modeling, workflow specification and synthesis, but strives to provide the automated composition functionality independent from a concrete workflow system.

We thank our brave first-generation users for their patience and constructive feedback that helped us to get APE into shape.
