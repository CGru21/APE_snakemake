### Good Java Practices

When contributing code, please adhere to the following good Java practices:

- **Code Style:** Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). This ensures consistency across the codebase and makes it easier for others to understand your code.
- **Documentation:** All methods and classes should be documented using Javadoc. This includes a description of the method's purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions thrown. Good documentation is crucial for maintainability and ease of use.
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for new features and bug fixes. We aim for high test coverage to ensure code quality and reliability. Use JUnit for testing your code.
- **Efficiency:** Write efficient code; avoid unnecessary computation or memory usage.
- **Readability:** Write readable and maintainable code. Use meaningful variable and method names, and keep methods short and focused.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Be open to feedback and willing to make changes as needed.
- **Description:** Provide a detailed description of the changes in your pull request. If it's related to an open issue, include a link to it in the description.
- **Testing:** Your changes should pass all existing tests, and any new functionality should be accompanied by new tests.
